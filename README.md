This is a program that allows you to map systemwide keyboard shortcuts to your Spotify.

This works while you are in other programs, and does not matter which device your Spotify is playing on. It can be a speaker, your phone, your laptop, etc.

I recommend you set this program to open when the system starts up. There is currently no setting for this within the app.

When opened, it opens in the system tray and there are a total of **7** currently available shortcuts, which are:

Pause/Play

Volume Up

Volume Down

Skip

Rewind

Play first playlist (URI currently not changeable)

Play second playlist (URI currently not changeable)


Examples of the (currently rough) UI:

Planned future features:

Change playlist 1 and playlist 2's URIs
